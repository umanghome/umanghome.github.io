      Hi, I am Umang. I love writing code to make computers do things so I can relax and be lazy instead. I love all
      things tech and superheroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work on websites and web apps, occasionally working on Android when the need arises. The feeling I get when
      the small utility scripts I write work cannot be put into words, so I'll skip that.
    </p>

      I completed my undergrad in Computer Science & Engineering from Babaria Institute of Technology in Vadodara
      (India) in May 2017.
